Chromatic Aberration is a stylistic effect that mimics the failure of a lens to properly focus all colors. The script `Chromatic Abberation` as the name suggests allows you to emulate that effect in your sign.

# Usage

![image](./assets/chromatic-abberation-gui.png){: style="height:216px;width:480px"}

x Offset and y Offset allows you to increase the size of the effect.

If you tick the checkbox `Keep Original Color`, the script will apply the effect but will not change the base color. If this is unticked, the base color will be whatever is the result of subtractive color mixing.

The three colors will allow user to change the colors of the effect. There is no need to change it most of the time since this is the default colors of chromatic abberation but if the user wants to change it, they can.
