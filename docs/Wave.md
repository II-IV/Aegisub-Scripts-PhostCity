Wave is a script that allows you to mimic the wavy signs through some fscx, fscy and fsp trickery. When you open the scripts, there are few parameters you can change, and you'll have to go through some trial and error to determine what values give you the result you want.

Below are few examples of what kind of waves you can achieve but depending on the values you use, you can create different types of waves as well.
