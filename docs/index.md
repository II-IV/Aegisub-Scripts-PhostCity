This is the collection of the Aegisub scripts made by me along with detailed explanation for its usage.

Scripts that I've written can broadly be classified into two types: scripts that are in [Dependency Control](https://github.com/TypesettingTools/DependencyControl) and those that are not. Scripts that are in Dependency Control are those scripts that are ready for broad public usage and those which aren't are either still in development or are not useful enough to be added.

## Installing Aegisub Scripts

The guide to installing both scripts that are available in Dependency Control and those that aren't is explained in this [guide](https://fansubbers.miraheze.org/wiki/Guide:Installing_Aegisub_scripts)

## Script/Feature Request and Bug Reporting

If you want to report bug or ask for a feature to be added in an already existing script or have an idea for a new script that you want to be made, you can reach out in the following places.

- [Github Issues](https://github.com/PhosCity/Aegisub-Scripts/issues)
- DM me at discord (`PhosCity#4786`)
- I haunt the hallways of GJM fansub discord server pretty regularly.

I can't assure I'll accept all requests but if it's good enough and possible by my knowledge, I'll try to get it made.
